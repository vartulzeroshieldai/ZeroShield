## Security Frameworks & Methodologies

ThreatShield employs industry-standard security frameworks to ensure comprehensive threat analysis:

### **STRIDE** Threat Classification
**STRIDE** is a threat modeling framework that categorizes security threats into six fundamental types:

- **S** - **Spoofing**: Impersonating someone or something else
- **T** - **Tampering**: Modifying data or code in unauthorized ways
- **R** - **Repudiation**: Denying having performed an action
- **I** - **Information Disclosure**: Exposing information to unauthorized parties
- **D** - **Denial of Service**: Disrupting or degrading service availability
- **E** - **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized elevated access

### **DREAD** Risk Assessment
**DREAD** is a risk assessment model that evaluates threats across five dimensions:

- **D** - **Damage**: Potential impact if the threat is exploited
- **R** - **Reproducibility**: How easily the threat can be reproduced
- **E** - **Exploitability**: How difficult it is to exploit the threat
- **A** - **Affected Users**: Number of users potentially impacted
- **D** - **Discoverability**: How easily the threat can be discovered

Each threat receives a **DREAD** score (1-10 scale) across all five dimensions, providing a quantitative risk assessment for prioritization and remediation planning.

## Target Users

### **Security Engineers**
*Automate threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, and **compliance**.*

**Real World Scenario:** Sarah, a Senior Security Engineer at a fintech startup, is tasked with conducting a comprehensive security assessment of their new payment processing system before the PCI audit next month. Using ThreatShield, she uploads the system architecture diagrams and connects the GitHub repository. Within hours, she receives a detailed threat model identifying 23 **STRIDE** threats, including critical API key exposure and authentication bypass vulnerabilities. The **DREAD** heatmap helps her prioritize the 7 high-risk issues that could fail PCI **compliance** controls. She exports an audit-ready report showing all findings mapped to PCI DSS requirements, saving weeks of manual analysis and ensuring the system passes the audit on the first try.

### **Developers & DevOps**
*Integrate risk analysis into CI/CD and shift security left.*

**Real World Scenario:** Mike, a DevOps Lead at a SaaS company, needs to implement security scanning in their CI/CD pipeline for 15 microservices. He integrates ThreatShield into their GitHub Actions workflow, enabling automatic threat modeling on every pull request. When a developer pushes code with a hardcoded database password, ThreatShield immediately flags it as a **STRIDE** Information Disclosure threat with a high **DREAD** score. The system blocks the merge, provides the developer with an actionable fix, and creates a **compliance** tracking ticket. This prevents 3 potential security incidents in the first month, reducing their security debt by 40% and accelerating their SOC2 certification timeline.

### **AI/ML & Product Teams**
*Secure and validate LLM/GenAI features with real threat modeling security probes.*

**Real World Scenario:** Dr. Lisa Chen, an AI Product Manager at a healthcare technology company, is launching an AI-powered patient consultation chatbot that handles sensitive medical data. Before going live, she runs ThreatShield's LLM threat modeling assessment, which executes 40+ threat modeling security probes. The results reveal high vulnerability to prompt injection attacks that could expose patient data, triggering failed HIPAA **compliance** controls. Using the detailed remediation suggestions, her team implements input sanitization and context filtering. After re-running the assessment, the risk level drops to "Low" and all **compliance** checks pass, allowing the chatbot to launch securely and handle thousands of patient interactions without security incidents.

### **Compliance & Audit Teams**
*Map vulnerabilities to **compliance** frameworks and track remediation.*

**Real World Scenario:** Robert, a **Compliance** Manager at a financial services company, needs to prepare for an annual ISO 27001 audit covering 8 different applications. Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of security controls, he uses ThreatShield to generate comprehensive **compliance** reports for each system. The platform automatically maps all identified vulnerabilities to ISO 27001 controls, showing that 15 out of 114 controls need attention. He creates remediation tickets with clear priorities based on **DREAD** scores and tracks progress through the dashboard. The audit-ready reports demonstrate 95% control coverage, impressing the external auditors and resulting in a clean audit report with only minor observations.

### **Cloud & Solution Architects**
*Design secure architectures with instant, actionable feedback.*

**Real World Scenario:** Elena, a Cloud Solution Architect at a global e-commerce company, is designing a new multi-cloud infrastructure for handling Black Friday traffic spikes. She uses ThreatShield to model the architecture with 12 microservices across AWS and Azure, including payment processing, user authentication, and inventory management. The threat model identifies 31 potential attack vectors, with the **DREAD** heatmap highlighting that 5 threats could cause service outages affecting millions of users. She redesigns the architecture to eliminate single points of failure, adds proper encryption at rest and in transit, and implements zero-trust networking. The final architecture passes all **OWASP** Top 10 for API Security checks and **compliance** requirements, ensuring a secure and scalable Black Friday deployment that handles 10x traffic without security incidents.

  - Further mapped to **OWASP** Top 10 for API Security vulnerabilities and failed **compliance** controls (ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST, SOC2, GDPR, etc.).
  - **Compliance** mapping is visualized per finding and overall scan.


### Code-Level Finding Explanation

<img width="800" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-29 173512" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445c5c0b-95bd-4cb7-9167-b0466bb3a638" />


**Description:** A close-up view of the code analysis within the MCP Scan, showing the exact file (**mcp_server.py**) and code snippet where the vulnerability was detected. The finding is given a **Medium** risk severity, accompanied by an LLM-generated **Explanation** of the command execution risk found in the code.


 

#### Deep-Dive: Analysis Pipeline

- **Step 1: Static Analysis**
    - When a scan is triggered, ThreatShield temporarily clones the selected MCP repository.
    - The system runs a suite of static analysis rules covering **OWASP** Top 10 for API Security, common code smells, secrets, and insecure configurations.
    - The analysis engine is chosen for its speed, accuracy, and extensibility (custom rules per project/language).
- **Step 2: LLM-Powered Findings**
    - Each finding is passed to an LLM for further analysis, generating:
        - Human-readable explanation of risk
        - Contextual remediation steps
        - Mapping to **compliance** controls (ISO, PCI, SOC2, NIST, GDPR, etc.)
- **Step 3: Dashboard and Reporting**
    - All results are visualized in the MCP scan dashboard, showing severity, status, **compliance** impact, and suggested fixes.
    - Reports can be exported for audit/evidence.


#### How It Benefits Users

- **Automated, deep static analysis** on every codebase.
- **LLM-powered explanations** for fast triage and remediation.
- **Clear compliance** gap visibility for every finding.
- **Audit-ready reporting** and **compliance** evidence on demand.

#### Hypothetical User Scenario

> **Jane**, DevSecOps Lead, pushes a new release to the MCP repo. ThreatShield automatically kicks off a scan. Within minutes, Jane sees 13 new findings‚Äîtwo critical SQL injection issues, several failed PCI controls, and a high-risk secrets leak. The LLM-generated explanations help her prioritize fixes, and she exports a **compliance** report for the next audit.
